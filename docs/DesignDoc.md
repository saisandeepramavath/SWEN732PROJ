### Software Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](Architecture.png)

The application follows a layered architecture comprising three main layers:

**Presentation Layer:** The front-end of the application, built with Expo React Native, which includes modules for group management, report views, authentication, and expense entry.

**Domain Layer:** This layer includes the core business logic, such as expense management (handling expenses, groups, payments, and notifications), user management, and report generation.

**Technical Services Layer:** This layer integrates Firebase services, including:
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
- **Currency Conversion:** A currency converter API to handle multi-currency transactions.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication for user sign-in and security.
- **Database:** Firestore as the primary real-time database for storing expenses, groups, and payments.

The architecture ensures a modular and scalable approach, making it easier to maintain and expand functionalities in the future.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Expo React Native
- **Backend:** Firebase Functions (Node.js/Python)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **Storage:** Firebase Storage (for receipt uploads, if required)
